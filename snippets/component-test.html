                    Now we provide each todo-item with the todo object
                    it's representing, so that its content can be dynamic.
                    We also need to provide each component with a "key",
                    which will be explained later.
                    Jeff: also need a global vuejs instance outside (app 7)
                    
                    Every Vue application starts by creating a new Vue instance with the Vue function:
                    
                    A Vue application consists of a root Vue instance created with new Vue
                    
                    For now, just know that all Vue components are also Vue instances, and so accept the same options object (except for a few root-specific options).
                    
                    It should be noted that properties in data are only reactive if they existed when the instance was created. (mean binding vm.a but later set vm.b, no changes is trigger into UI), so need to set a placeholder in data: 
                    { vn: { b: 0} }
                        + The only exception to this being the use of Object.freeze(), which prevents existing properties from being changed, which also means the reactivity system canâ€™t track changes.
                        + In addition to data properties, Vue instances expose a number of useful instance properties and methods. These are prefixed with $

            <todo-item v-for="item in groceryList" v-bind:todo="item" v-bind:key="item.id">
            </todo-item>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <script>
        Vue.component('todo-item', {
            props: ['todo'],
            template: '<li>{{ todo.text }}</li>'
        })

        var app7 = new Vue({
            el: '#app-7',
            data: {
                groceryList: [{
                        id: 0,
                        text: 'Vegetables'
                    },
                    {
                        id: 1,

                        id: 2,
                        text: 'Whatever else humans are supposed to eat'
                    }
                ]
